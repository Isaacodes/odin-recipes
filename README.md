# odin-recipes

With this project I built a website which highlights my 3 favorites recipes.

I included images with the ```<img>``` tag.
  - I used the "alt" attribute in my ```<img>``` tag to make the site more accessible for screen readers.

I utilized relative links to the recipe pages with the ```<a>``` tag.

I included unordered lists ```<ul>``` for ingredients. 

I included ordered lists ```<ol>``` for recipe directions.

Additionally, I made use of frequent git commits and comments to ensure the project is easily accessible for future use and modification. I attempted to follow industry standards at every turn.
